## High Volume Data

The Ignite UI for Angular category chart component is capable of handling high volumes of data, ranging into the millions of data points, as demonstated in the following demo.

### Demo

<div class="sample-container loading" style="height: 500px">
    <iframe id="category-chart-high-volume-sample-iframe" src='{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/category-chart-high-volume-sample' width="100%" height="100%" seamless frameBorder="0" onload="onXPlatSampleIframeContentLoaded(this);"></iframe>
</div>
<div>
    <button data-localize="stackblitz" disabled class="stackblitz-btn" data-iframe-id="category-chart-high-volume-sample-iframe" data-demos-base-url="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}">View on StackBlitz
    </button>
</div>

<div class="divider--half"></div>

### Performance Optimizations

There are several chart features and Angular specific features that affect performance of the chart and they should be considered when optimizing performance in your application.

When storing lots of data in properties in your components to bind against, you should make sure to set `changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` in your `@Component` decorator. Setting this will tell Angular not to dig deeply into changes within your data array, something you don't want Angular doing every change detection cycle.

-   Instead of Angular automatically telling the charts how they should react to data changes, its your responsibility to notify the components how the data they have been bound to has been modified.
    -   Reacting to these delta notifications can be done much more efficiently than to have to compare a 1M record array for any changes, every time Angular runs a change detection.
    -   Look for the `notify*` methods on each chart for more information about how to notify the chart of changes to the data it is bound against.
-   When Angular is in Debug mode, there is a lot of overhead in some browsers that will drag down performance. When evaluating real world performance always make sure to serve or build with `--prod`

> Note If any performance issues are observed in your application, performance of the charts has shown improvement when run in production builds and not debug builds.  Please be sure to run production builds for these scenarios.
