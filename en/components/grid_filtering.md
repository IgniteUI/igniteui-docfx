### Grid Filtering

The Grid component in Ignite UI for Angular provides extensive filtering API through the Data Container to which the grid is bound.

#### Demo

<div class="sample-container loading" style="height:620px">
    <iframe id="grid-sample-iframe" src='{environment:demosBaseUrl}/grid-filtering-sample' width="100%" height="100%" seamless frameBorder="0" onload="onSampleIframeContentLoaded(this);"></iframe>
</div>
<br/>
<div>
<button data-localize="stackblitz" class="stackblitz-btn" data-iframe-id="grid-sample-iframe" data-demos-base-url="{environment:demosBaseUrl}">view on stackblitz</button>
</div>
<div class="divider--half"></div>

There's a default filtering strategy provided out of the box, as well as all the standard filtering conditions, which the developer can replace with their own implementation. In addition, we've provided a way to easily plug in your own custom filtering conditions. The Grid currently provides not only a simplistic filtering UI but also more complex filtering options. Depending on the set `dataType` of the column the correct set of [**filtering conditions**](grid.md#filtering-conditions) will be loaded inside the filter UI dropdown. Additionally, you can set the `filteringIgnoreCase` and the initial `filteringCondition` property of the column.

```html
<igx-column field="ProductName" filterable="true" dataType="string"></igx-column>
<igx-column field="Price" filterable="true" dataType="number"></igx-column>
```

> [!NOTE]
> If values of type `string` are used by column of dataType `Date`, the grid won't parse it to `Date` objects and using filtering conditions won't be possible. If you want to use `string` objects, additional logic should be implemented on the application level, in order to parse the values to `Date` object.

You can filter any column or a combination of columns through the grid API. The grid exposes two methods for this task:

*   `filter` - filter a single column or a combination of columns.

```typescript
// Single column filtering

// Filter the `ProductName` column for values which `contains` the `myproduct` substring, ignoring case
this.grid.filter('ProductName', 'myproduct', STRING_FILTERS.contains, true);
```

The only required parameters are the column field and the filtering term. Both the condition and the case sensitivity will be inferred from the column properties if not provided. In the case of multiple filtering, the method accepts an array of filtering expressions.

> [!NOTE]
> The filtering operation **DOES NOT** change the underlying data source of the grid.

```typescript
// Multi column filtering

this.grid.filter([
    { fieldName: 'ProductName', searchVal: 'myproduct' condition: STRING_FILTERS.contains, ignoreCase: true},
    { fieldName: 'Price', searchVal: 55, condition: NUMBER_FILTERS.greaterThan }
]);
```

*   `filterGlobal` - filter all the columns in the grid

```typescript
// Filter all cells for a value which contains `myproduct`
this.grid.filterGlobal('myproduct', STRING.contains, true);
```

*   `clearFilter` - removes any applied filtering from the target column. If called with no arguments it will clear the filtering of all columns.

```typescript
// Remove the filtering state from the ProductName column
this.grid.clearFilter('ProductName');

// Clears the filtering state from all columns
this.grid.clearFilter();
```

#### Initial filtered state

It is possible to set the initial filtering state of the grid by an array of expressions to the `filteringExpressions` property of the grid.

```typescript
public ngOnInit() {
    this.grid.filteringExpressions = [
        { fieldName: 'ProductName', searchVal: 'myproduct' condition: STRING_FILTERS.contains, ignoreCase: true},
        { fieldName: 'Price', searchVal: 55, condition: NUMBER_FILTERS.greaterThan }
    ];
}
```

#### Filtering logic

The `filteringLogic` property of the grid controls how filtering multiple columns will resolve in the grid. You can change it at any time through the grid API or through the grid input property.

```typescript
import { FilteringLogic } from 'igniteui-angular/main';
...

this.grid.filteringLogic = FilteringLogic.OR;
```

The default value of `AND` returns only the rows that match all the currently applied filtering expressions. Following the example above, a row will be returned when both the 'ProductName' cell value contains 'myproduct' and the 'Price' cell value is greater than 55.

When set to `OR`, a row will be returned when either the 'ProductName' cell value contains 'myproduct' or the 'Price' cell value is greater than 55.
