# Angular Polar Chart

Angular Polar Chart is a group of series that use the polar (angle, radius) coordinate system instead of the Cartesian (x, y) coordinate system to plot data in chart. In other words, Polar Chart take concepts of Scatter Series and wrap them around a circle rather than stretching along a horizontal line. This group of series is used to show the relationship among the items in several distinct series of data using the polar coordinates system.

Polar Chart draw attention to uneven intervals or clusters of data. They are often used to plot scientific data (e.g. wind direction and speed, direction, and strength of magnetic field, location of objects in solar system), and can highlight the deviation of collected data from predicted results.

## Angular Polar Line Chart

The Polar Line Chart belongs to a group of polar charts and is rendered using a collection of straight lines connecting data points in polar (angle/radius) coordinate system. Polar Line Charts use the same concepts of data plotting as the Scatter Line Chart with the difference that the visualization wraps data points around a circle rather than stretching them along a horizontal line.

## Angular Polar Spline

The Polar Spline Chart belongs to a group of polar charts and is rendered using a collection of curved splines connecting data points in polar (angle/radius) coordinate system. Polar Spline Charts use the same concepts of data plotting as the Scatter Spline Chart with the difference that the visualization wraps data points around a circle rather than stretching them along a horizontal line.

## Styling Angular Polar Charts

Once our radial chart is created, we may want to make some further styling customizations such as a change of the line colors, marker types, or outline colors of those markers.
