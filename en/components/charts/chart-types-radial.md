# Angular Radial Chart

Radial Chart is a group of series that takes data and render it as collection of data points wrapped around a circle (rather than stretching along a horizontal line as Category Series do). Just like Category Series, Radial Chart are also mapping a list of categories from the minimum to the maximum of the extent of the chart, and support the same category grouping mechanisms of Category Series.

</div>

## Styling Angular Radial Charts

Once our radial chart is created, we may want to make some further styling customizations such as a change of the line colors, marker types, or outline colors of those markers.
