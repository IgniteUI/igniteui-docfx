# Angular Step Chart

Angular Step Chart belongs to a group of Category Series and it is rendered using a collection of points connected by continuous vertical and horizontal lines. For Step Area Chart, the area below lines are filled in. Values are represented on the y-axis and categories are displayed on the x-axis. This emphasizes the amount of change over a period of time or compares multiple items. 

<div class="sample-container loading" style="height: 400px">
    <iframe id="cc-chart-with-legend" src='{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/category-chart-step-line-with-legend' width="100%" height="100%" seamless frameBorder="0" onload="onXPlatSampleIframeContentLoaded(this);" alt="Angular Step Line Chart with Legend"></iframe>
</div>

## Angular Step Chart with Single Series

In this example, the Step Chart is showing the change of value over time for the amount of renewable electricity produced for several years in Europe.

<div class="sample-container loading" style="height: 400px">
    <iframe id="cc-chart-with-legend" src='{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/category-chart-step-line-single-source' width="100%" height="100%" seamless frameBorder="0" onload="onXPlatSampleIframeContentLoaded(this);" alt="Angular Step Line Chart with Single Source"></iframe>
</div>

## Angular Step Chart with Multiple Series

The Step Chart is often used to show the change of value over time such as the amount of renewable electricity produced for several years between regions, as we have shown in the example below.

<div class="sample-container loading" style="height: 400px">
    <iframe id="cc-chart-with-legend" src='{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/category-chart-step-line-multiple-sources' width="100%" height="100%" seamless frameBorder="0" onload="onXPlatSampleIframeContentLoaded(this);" alt="Angular Step Line Chart with Multiple Sources"></iframe>
