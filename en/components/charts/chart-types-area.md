# Angular Area Chart

Angular Area Chart, or Area Graph, is a type of category area graph that shows a collection of points connected by line segments with the area below the line filled in. The Y-Axis (labels on left side) show a numeric value, while the X-Axis (bottom labels) show a time-series or comparison category. Area Chart emphasizes the amount of change over a period of time or compares multiple items as well as the relationship of parts to a whole by displaying the total of the plotted values. You can include one or more data sets to compare, which would render as multiple areas in the chart.

<div class="sample-container loading" style="height: 400px">
    <iframe id="cc-chart-with-legend" src='{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/category-chart-area-chart-with-legend' width="100%" height="100%" seamless frameBorder="0" onload="onXPlatSampleIframeContentLoaded(this);" alt="Angular Area Chart with Legend"></iframe>
</div>

## Angular Area Chart with Single Series

Angular Area Chart is often used to show the change of value over time such as the amount of renewable electricity produced since 2009 over a ten-year period for Europe, as shown in the example below.

<div class="sample-container loading" style="height: 400px">
    <iframe id="cc-chart-with-legend" src='{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/category-chart-area-chart-single-source' width="100%" height="100%" seamless frameBorder="0" onload="onXPlatSampleIframeContentLoaded(this);" alt="Angular Area Chart with Single Series"></iframe>
</div>

<div class="divider--half"></div>

## Angular Area Chart with Multiple Series

Angular Area Chart allows you to combine multiple series and compare or see how they change over time. All we need to do is bind to a data source containing the data for China and the USA, and the area chart will automatically update to fit the additional data.

<div class="sample-container loading" style="height: 400px">
    <iframe id="cc-chart-with-legend" src='{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/category-chart-area-chart-multiple-sources' width="100%" height="100%" seamless frameBorder="0" onload="onXPlatSampleIframeContentLoaded(this);" alt="Angular Area Chart with Multiple Sources"></iframe>
</div>

## Angular Advanced Area Chart

Additional styling settings can be configured on Area Chart series such marker outlines, marker brushes, series brushes, and series outlines as demonstrated below.

<div class="sample-container loading" style="height: 400px">
    <iframe id="cc-chart-with-legend" src='{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/category-chart-area-chart-styling' width="100%" height="100%" seamless frameBorder="0" onload="onXPlatSampleIframeContentLoaded(this);" alt="Angular Area Chart Styling"></iframe>
</div>

## Angular Step Area Chart

The Step Area Chart belongs to a group of category charts and it is rendered using a collection of points connected by continuous vertical and horizontal lines with the area below lines filled in. Values are represented on the y-axis and categories are displayed on the x-axis. The step area chart emphasizes the amount of change over a period of time or compares multiple items. 

<div class="sample-container loading" style="height: 400px">
    <iframe id="cc-chart-with-legend" src='{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/category-chart-step-area-multiple-sources' width="100%" height="100%" seamless frameBorder="0" onload="onXPlatSampleIframeContentLoaded(this);" alt="Angular Step Area Chart"></iframe>
</div>

## Angular Stacked Area Chart

Stacked Area Charts are rendered using a collection of points connected by line segments, with the area below the line filled in and stacked on top of each other. Stacked Area charts follow all the same requirements as area charts, the only difference is that visually the shaded areas are stacked on top of each other. Renewable electricity produced between USA, Europe and China is demonstrated in the example below.

## Angular Stacked 100 Area Series

The Stacked 100 Area Chart is identical to the Stacked Area Chart in all aspects except in their treatment of the values on y-axis. Instead of presenting a direct representation of the data, the Stacked 100 Area presents the data in terms of percent of the sum of all values in a data point. Sometimes the series represent part of a whole being changed over time e.g. a country’s energy consumption related to the sources from which it is produced. In such cases representing all stacked elements equally may be a better idea.
