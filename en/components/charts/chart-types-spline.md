# Angular Spline Chart

Angular Spline Chart belongs to a group of Category Series and it is rendered using a collection of points connected by smooth curves of spline.  Values are represented on the y-axis and categories are displayed on the x-axis. Spline Chart emphasizes the amount of change over a period of time or compares multiple items as well as the relationship of parts to a whole by displaying the total of the plotted values. The Spline Chart is identical to the Line Chart in all aspects except that line connecting data points has spline interpolation and smoothing for improved presentation of data.

<div class="sample-container loading" style="height: 400px">
    <iframe id="cc-chart-with-legend" src='{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/category-chart-spline-with-legend' width="100%" height="100%" seamless frameBorder="0" onload="onXPlatSampleIframeContentLoaded(this);" alt="Angular Spline Chart with Legend"></iframe>

## Angular Spline Chart with Single Series

The Spline Chart is often used to show the change of value over time such as the amount of renewable electricity produced since 2009 over a ten-year period for Europe, as shown in the example below.

<div class="sample-container loading" style="height: 400px">
    <iframe id="cc-chart-with-legend" src='{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/category-chart-spline-single-source' width="100%" height="100%" seamless frameBorder="0" onload="onXPlatSampleIframeContentLoaded(this);" alt="Angular Spline Chart with Single Source"></iframe>
</div>

## Angular Spline Chart with Multiple Series

Since the Spline Chart allows you to combine multiple series and compare or see how they change over time. All we need to do is bind to a data source containing the data for China and the USA, and the chart will automatically update to fit the additional data.

<div class="sample-container loading" style="height: 400px">
    <iframe id="cc-chart-with-legend" src='{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/category-chart-spline-multiple-sources' width="100%" height="100%" seamless frameBorder="0" onload="onXPlatSampleIframeContentLoaded(this);" alt="Angular Spline Chart with Multiple Sources"></iframe>
</div>

## Angular Spline Chart Styling

If you need a Spline Chart with more features such as composite other series, you can configure the markers, marker brushes, marker outlines, series brushes and series outlines as demonstrated below.

<div class="sample-container loading" style="height: 400px">
    <iframe id="cc-chart-with-legend" src='{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/category-chart-spline-styling' width="100%" height="100%" seamless frameBorder="0" onload="onXPlatSampleIframeContentLoaded(this);" alt="Angular Spline Chart Styling"></iframe>
</div>

## Angular Stacked Spline Chart

The Stacked Spline Chart is often used to show the change of value over time such as the amount of renewable electricity produced for several years between regions, as we have shown in the example below.

<div class="sample-container loading" style="height: 400px">
    <iframe id="cc-chart-with-legend" src='{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/data-chart-stacked-spline-chart' width="100%" height="100%" seamless frameBorder="0" onload="onXPlatSampleIframeContentLoaded(this);" alt="Angular Stacked Spline Chart"></iframe>
</div>

<div class="divider--half"></div>

## Angular Stacked 100 Spline Chart

The Stacked 100 Spline Chart is identical to the Stacked Spline Chart in all aspects except in their treatment of the values on y-axis. Instead of presenting a direct representation of the data, the Stacked 100 Spline Chart presents the data in terms of percent of the sum of all values in a data point. The example below shows a study made for online shopping traffic by departments via tablet, phone and personal computers.

<div class="sample-container loading" style="height: 400px">
    <iframe id="cc-chart-with-legend" src='{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/data-chart-stacked-100-spline-chart' width="100%" height="100%" seamless frameBorder="0" onload="onXPlatSampleIframeContentLoaded(this);" alt="Angular Stacked 100 Spline Chart"></iframe>
</div>
