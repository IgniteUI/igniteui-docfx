## Angular Chart Example

This Angular column chart, or column graph, example shows Olympics medals by Country. The Angular column chart belongs to a group of category charts that include at one or more numeric or time-series based data point, and one string data point, that compares data values by differing column heights. In this example, the Y-Axis, or left-side labels of the chart, are displaying numeric data showing the number of medals won, and the X-Axis, or bottom labels, are showing a time value, in this case Year. The columns are the category values representing different countries, like USA, Japan and Germany.

## Angular Chart and Graph Types

The Angular product has over 65 different chart and graph types for any scenario – from a single chart display to an interactive dashboard. You can create Angular charts like Pie, Bar, Area, Line, Point, Stacked, Doughnut, Scatter, Gauge, Polar, Treemap, Stock, Financial, Geospatial Maps and more for your mobile or web apps. The benefit of our Angular chart vs. others is full support for features like: 

-   Responsive Web Design built in 
-   Interactive Panning and Zooming with Mouse, Keyboard and Touch 
-   Full Control of Chart Animation 
-   Chart Drill-Down Events 
-   Real-Time Streaming Support 
-   High-Volume (Millions of Data Points) Support 
-   Trends Lines and other Data Analysis features 

Built with a modular design of axis, markers, series, legend, and annotation layers, the Angular chart makes it easy to design a render any type of data story. Build a simple chart with a single data series, or build more complex data stories with multiple series of data, with multiple axis in composite views. 

### Angular Bar Chart

The Angular Bar Chart, or Bar Graph is among the most common category chart types used to quickly compare frequency, count, total, or average of data in different categories with data encoded by horizontal bars of equal width and differing lengths. They are ideal for showing variations in the value of an item over time, data distribution, sorted data ranking (high to low, worst to best). Data is represented using a collection of rectangles that extend from the left to right of the chart towards the values of data points.

### Angular Pie Chart

The Angular Pie Chart, or Pie Graph, is a very common part-to-whole chart type. Part-to-whole charts show how categories (parts) of a data set add up to a total (whole) value. Categories are shown in proportion to other categories based on their value percentage to the total value being analyzed. A pie chart renders data values as sections in a circular, or pie-shaped graph. Each section, or pie slice, has an arc length proportional to its underlying data value. The total values represented by the pie slices represent a whole value, like 100 or 100%. Pie charts are perfect for small data sets and are easy to read at a quick glance.

### Angular Line Chart

The Angular Line Chart, or Line Graph is a type of category line graph shows the continuous data values represented by points connected by straight line segments of one or more quantities over a period time for showing trends and performing comparative analysis. The Y-Axis (labels on left side) show a numeric value, while the X-Axis (bottom labels) are showing a time-series or comparison category. You can include one or more data sets to compare, which would render as multiple lines in the chart.

### Angular Doughnut Chart

The Angular Doughnut Chart, or Doughnut Graph, is a variant of a Pie Chart, proportionally illustrating the occurrences of a variable in a circle to represents parts of a whole. The doughnut chart has a circular opening at the center of the pie chart, where a title or category explanation can be displayed. Doughnut charts can support multiple concentric rings, with built-in support for visualizing hierarchical data.

### Sparkline Chart

A Sparkline Chart, or Sparkline Graph is a type of category graph intended for rendering within a small-scale layout such as within a grid cell, or anywhere a word-sized visualization is needed to tell a data story. Like other Angular chart types, the Sparkline Chart has several visual elements and corresponding features that can be configured and customized such as the chart type, markers, ranges, trendlines, unknown value plotting, and tooltips. Sparkline charts can render as a Line Chart, Area Chart, Column Chart or Win / Loss Chart. The difference between the full-sized chart equivalent to the Spark-chart, is the Y-Axis (left side labels) and X-Axis (bottom labels) are not visible. Learn more about our [sparkline charts](../sparkline.md).

### Bubble chart

A Bubble Chart, or Bubble Graph, is used to show data comprising of three numeric values. Two of the values are plotted as an intersecting point using a Cartesian (X, Y) coordinate system, and the third value is rendered as the diameter size of the point. This gives the Bubble Chart its name - a visualization of varying sized bubbles along the X and Y coordinates of the plot. The Angular Bubble Chart is used to show relationships of data correlations with the data value differences rendered by size. You can also use a fourth data dimension, typically color, to further differentiate the values in your Bubble chart. Learn more about our [bubble charts](chart-types-scatter.md#angular-scatter-bubble-chart).

### Financial chart / Stock Chart

The Angular Financial or Stock Chart, is a composite visualization that renders stock data and financial data in a time-series chart that includes interactive visual elements in a toolbar like day / week / month filters, chart type selection, volume type selection, indicators selection and trends lines selection. Designed for customization, the Angular Stock Chart can be customized in any way to give an easier visualization and interpretation of your data. The financial chart renders the date-time data along the X-Axis (bottom labels) and shows fields like Open, High, Low and Close volumes. The type of chart to render the Time-Series data can be Bar, Candle, Column, or Line. Learn more about our [financial charts](chart-types-financial.md).

### Column chart

The Angular Column Chart, or Column Graph is among the most common category chart types used to quickly compare frequency, count, total, or average of data in different categories with data encoded by vertical bars of equal width and differing lengths. They are ideal for showing variations in the value of an item over time, data distribution, sorted data ranking (high to low, worst to best). Data is represented using a collection of rectangles that extend from the top to bottom of the chart towards the values of data points. Learn more about our [column charts](chart-types-column.md).

### Polar Area chart

The Angular Polar Area Chart or Polar Graph belongs to a group of polar charts and has a shape of a filled polygon which vertices or corners are located at the polar (angle/radius) coordinates of data points. The Polar Area Chart uses the same concepts of data plotting as the Scatter Chart but wraps data points around a circle rather than stretching them along a horizontal line. Like with other series types, multiple Polar Area Charts can be plotted in the same data chart and they can be overlaid on each other to show differences and similarities between data sets. Learn more about our [polar charts](chart-types-polar.md).

### Scatter chart

The Angular Scatter Chart, or Scatter Graph, is used to show the relationship between two values using a Cartesian (X, Y) coordinate system to plot data. Each data point is rendered as the intersecting point of the data value on the X and Y Axis. Scatter charts draw attention to uneven intervals or clusters of data. They can highlight the deviation of collected data from predicted results and they are often used to plot scientific and statistical data. The Angular Scatter chart organizes and plots data chronologically (even if the data is not in chronological order before binding) on X-Axis and Y-Axis. Learn more about our [scatter charts](chart-types-scatter.md).

### Spline Chart

The Angular Spline Chart, or Spline Graph is a type of category line graph shows the continuous data values represented by points connected by smooth line segments of one or more quantities over a period time for showing trends and performing comparative analysis. The Y-Axis (labels on left side) show a numeric value, while the X-Axis (bottom labels) are showing a time-series or comparison category. You can include one or more data sets to compare, which would render as multiple lines in the chart. The Angular Spline chart is identical to the Angular Spline chart, the only different being the line chart is points connected by straight lines, and the spline chart points are connected by smooth curves. Learn more about our [spline charts](chart-types-spline.md).

### Stepline Chart

A Step Line Chart, or Step Line Graph, is a category charts that renders a collection of data points connected by continuous vertical and horizontal lines forming a step-like progression. Values are represented on the Y-Axis (left labels) and categories are displayed on the X-Axis (bottom labels). The Angular Step Line chart emphasizes the amount of change over a period of time or compares multiple items. The Angular Step Line chart is identical to the Angular step area chart in all aspects except that the area below the step lines is not filled in. Learn more about our [step line charts](chart-types-step.md)

### Timeline Charts / Time-Series Charts

A Time-Series Chart, or Timeline Graph, is a visualization that treats the data as a sequence of category data items that are sorted by then rendered by date. Labels on this axis are placed along the X-Axis (bottom Axis), according to the date-time value. The Angular Time-Series is use to show Financial Series, Range Series, and Category Series (Line, Area, Column, Point, Spline, Scatter, Waterfall and the Stacked equivalents of those chart types). The Time-Series also supports the ability to exclude intervals of data with breaks. As a result, labels will not appear at the excluded interval. For example, working/non-working days, holidays, or weekends.

## Angular Charts Key Features

Show how your data changes over time with our built-in Time Axis. We’ll dynamically change time scales and label formats, as you interact with your chart. We’ve included a complete Financial Chart with all of the features you’ve come to expect in your financial charts, like Yahoo Finance or Google Finance.

### Angular Dynamic Charts

Visualize your data by creating new composite views and overlapping multiple series in single chart. In the Chart, you can display and overlap multiple chart columns to create stacked columns.

### Custom Tooltips

Visualize your data by creating new composite views and overlapping multiple series in single chart. In the Chart, you can customize tooltips with images, data binding, and even combine tooltips of multiple series into single tooltip. 

### Real-Time, High-Performance Charting

Display millions of data points with milliseconds-level updates in real time with live, streaming data. You will experience no lag, no screen-flicker, and no visual delays, even as you interact with the chart on a touch-device. 

#### Modular Design

The Angular chart is designed for modularity. Only features that are needed are part of your deployment, so you get the smallest possible footprint in your rendered pages.

<img class="img" src="../images/charts/ignite-ui-angular-financial-chart-modular-design-1100.jpg"/>

#### Smart Data Binding

Let us choose the chart type. Our smart Data Adapter automatically chooses the best chart type for the data. All you do is set the data source and we do the rest.

<img class="img" src="../images/charts/ignite-ui-angular-financial-chart-smart-data-binding-1100.jpg"/>

#### Trend Lines

We support every trend line you’ll ever need, including linear (x), quadratic (x2), cubic (x3), quartic (x4), quintic (x5), logarithmic (logn x), exponential (ex), and power law (axk + o(xk)) trend lines.

<img class="img" src="../images/charts/ignite-ui-angular-financial-chart-trendlines-1100.jpg"/>

#### Interactive Panning and Zooming

Use single or multi-touch, keyboard, zoom bar, mouse wheel, drag-select for any rectangular region with the mouse to zoom in for close-up look at data points, scroll data history, or pan data regions.

<img class="img" src="../images/charts/ignite-ui-angular-financial-chart-zooming-1100.gif"/>

#### Markers, Tooltips, and Templates

Use one of 10 marker types to highlight data or use simple tooltips or multi-axis and multi-series chart tooltips with custom chart templates to give more context and meaning to your data.

<img class="img" src="../images/charts/ignite-ui-angular-financial-chart-custom-tooltips-1100.jpg"/>

#### High-Volume Data Handling

Optimize the performance of your financial chart to render millions of data points by modifying the `changeDetection` setting. This setting lets you control how Angular treats your data array when looking for changes and keeping your high-volume chart smoothly running.
