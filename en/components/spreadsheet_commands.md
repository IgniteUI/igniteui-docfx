## Working with Commands

This topic explains how to perform different operations with the control using commands.

### Demo

<div class="sample-container loading" style="height: 500px">
    <iframe id="spreadsheet-commands-sample-iframe" src='{environment:demosBaseUrl}/spreadsheet/spreadsheet-commands' width="100%" height="100%" seamless="" frameBorder="0" onload="onDvSampleIframeContentLoaded(this);"></iframe>
</div>

<div class="divider--half"></div>

### Dependencies

Before making use of the commands you will want to import the SpreadsheetAction

```typescript
import { IgxSpreadsheetComponent } from "igniteui-angular-spreadsheet/ES5/igx-spreadsheet-component";
import { SpreadsheetAction } from "igniteui-angular-spreadsheet/ES5/SpreadsheetAction";
```

<div class="divider--half"></div>

### Usage

The following snippt shows how you can setup the data validation rules

```typescript
@ViewChild("spreadsheet", { read: IgxSpreadsheetComponent })
public spreadsheet: IgxSpreadsheetComponent;

public zoomIn(): void {
    this.spreadsheet.executeAction(SpreadsheetAction.ZoomIn);
}

public zoomOut(): void {
    this.spreadsheet.executeAction(SpreadsheetAction.ZoomOut);
}
```
