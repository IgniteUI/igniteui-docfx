# Angular Esri Utility

The resource topic provides implementation of an utility that helps with using [`IgxArcGISOnlineMapImagery`]({environment:dvApiBaseUrl}/products/ignite-ui-angular/api/docs/typescript/latest/classes/igxarcgisonlinemapimagery.html) provided by Esri Maps in [`IgxGeographicMapComponent`]({environment:dvApiBaseUrl}/products/ignite-ui-angular/api/docs/typescript/latest/classes/igxgeographicmapcomponent.html).

## Code Snippet

```ts
export class EsriUtility {

    public static getUri(style: EsriStyle): string {
        let isHttpSecured = window.location.toString().startsWith("https:");
        // resolving Esri Server uri based on hosting website
        let uri: string = style;
        if (!isHttpSecured) {
            uri = uri.replace("https:", "http:");
        }
        return uri;
    }
}
