## Required Modules

The [`IgxSpreadsheetComponent`]({environment:dvApiBaseUrl}/products/ignite-ui-angular/api/docs/typescript/latest/classes/igxspreadsheetcomponent.html) requires the following modules:

```ts
import { IgxExcelModule } from 'igniteui-angular-excel';
import { IgxSpreadsheetModule } from 'igniteui-angular-spreadsheet';

@NgModule({
    imports: [
        // ...
        IgxExcelModule,
        IgxSpreadsheetModule,
        // ...
    ]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

<div class="divider--half"></div>

## Usage

Now that the Angular spreadsheet module is imported, next is the basic configuration of the spreadsheet.

```html
<igx-spreadsheet #spreadsheet height="500px" width="100%">
</igx-spreadsheet>
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> In the following code snippet, an external [ExcelUtility](excel-utility.md) class is used to save and load a [`workbook`]({environment:dvApiBaseUrl}/products/ignite-ui-angular/api/docs/typescript/latest/classes/igxspreadsheetcomponent.html#workbook).

The following demonstrates how to load a workbook into the Angular spreadsheet

```ts
import { IgxSpreadsheetComponent } from 'igniteui-angular-spreadsheet';
import { ExcelUtility } from 'ExcelUtility';

// ...

@ViewChild("spreadsheet", { read: IgxSpreadsheetComponent })
public spreadsheet: IgxSpreadsheetComponent;

ngOnInit() {
    const excelFile = '../../assets/Sample1.xlsx';
    ExcelUtility.loadFromUrl(excelFile).then((w) => {
      this.spreadsheet.workbook = w;
    });
}
```
