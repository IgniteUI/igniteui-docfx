# Default Theme

The _**light**_ version of the Material theme is the default theme in Ignite UI for Angular. To use it you need to include the `theme` mixin after the `core` mixin.

```scss
@use "igniteui-angular/theming" as *;

// IMPORTANT: Prior to Ignite UI for Angular version 13 use:
// @import '~igniteui-angular/lib/core/styles/themes/index';
@include core();
@include theme(
  $palette: $light-material-palette,
  $schema: $light-material-schema
);

// We can also include the Material font and font scaling
@include typography(
  $font-family: $material-typeface,
  $type-scale: $material-type-scale
);
```

## Material Dark Theme

```scss
@use "igniteui-angular/theming" as *;

// IMPORTANT: Prior to Ignite UI for Angular version 13 use:
// @import '~igniteui-angular/lib/core/styles/themes/index';
@include core();
@include theme(
  $palette: $dark-material-palette,
  $schema: $dark-material-schema
);

@include typography(
  $font-family: $material-typeface,
  $type-scale: $material-type-scale
);
```

If you want to use only the dark schema, but with your own palette you have to manually do the following:

```scss
@use "igniteui-angular/theming" as *;

// IMPORTANT: Prior to Ignite UI for Angular version 13 use:
// @import '~igniteui-angular/lib/core/styles/themes/index';
@include core();

$primary-color: #2ab759;
$secondary-color: #f96a88;
$surface-color: #303030;

// IMPORTANT, the primary, secondary and surface colors are required
// The $gray will ensure that all the black text, borders, etc will become a shade of white in order to be visible against a dark background
$my-color-palette: palette(
  $primary: $primary-color,
  $secondary: $secondary-color,
  $surface: $surface-color,
  $gray: #fff,
);

@include theme($my-color-palette, $schema: $dark-schema);
```

Since all individual components use the `$light-material-palette` by default, if you don't specify the rest of the colors like $info and $error they will use their default values from the `$light-material-palette`.
