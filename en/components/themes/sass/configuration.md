# Configuration

<div class="highlight">The Ignite UI for Angular theming library exposes several input arguments variables that let you configure how the theming engine works.</div>
<div class="divider"></div>

## Global Variables

Here's a list of global Sass variables forwarded in the main theming module:

| Variable Name | Description                                                                 |
|:-------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| `$components` | Stores a register of all component themes. Used for tree-shaking.           |
| `$dropped-themes`  | Stores a register of dropped themes. Used for tree-shaking. |

## Scrollbar Styling

The Ignite UI for Angular themes ship with custom scrollbar styles that allow you to change the width and/or the colors of all scrollbars in your application. To apply the included styles, make sure to set the `ig-scrollbar` class to an element that contains your root app component.

To customize the scrollbar further, you can create a new scrollbar style with the [`scrollbar-theme`]({environment:sassApiUrl}/index.html#function-scrollbar-theme) function. The function accepts arguments for style changes on the scrollbar. We can customize the scrollbar size, color, border, min-height... and many more.

```scss
// app.component.scss
//Here we set the scrollbar to have size of 16px, scrollbar thumb to be in color pink, and scrolblar track to be in color green
$my-scrollbar-theme: scrollbar-theme($sb-size: 16px, $sb-thumb-bg-color: pink, $sb-track-bg-color: green);

//We use 'css-vars' mixin for generating the css variables with the new scrollbar values.
@include css-vars($my-scrollbar-theme);
```
