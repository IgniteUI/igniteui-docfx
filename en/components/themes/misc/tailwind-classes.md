# Tailwind CSS Integration with Ignite UI for Angular
<p class="highlight">Ignite UI for Angular offers full theming customization through CSS variables and a powerful Sass engine. In this guide, you'll learn how to integrate Tailwind CSS into an Angular project and enhance it with custom utility classes provided by the `igniteui-theming` package. These classes expose Ignite UI design tokens for colors, shadows, and typography, enabling a seamless utility-first styling experience.</p>
<br>

## Overview

> [!NOTE]
> This guide assumes you already have **Ignite UI for Angular** installed. If not, run:
>
> ```cmd
> ng add igniteui-angular
> ```

### 1. Install Tailwind
Install tailwind using the following command:

```cmd
npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss postcss --force
```

### 2.Configure PostCSS Plugins

Create a `.postcssrc.json` file in the root of your project and add the `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin to your PostCSS configuration.

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "@tailwindcss/postcss": {}
  }
}
```

### 3.Import Tailwind CSS
In your main stylesheet (`styles.css` or `styles.scss`), import Tailwind and the Ignite UI Tailwind theme configuration.

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "igniteui-theming/tailwind/theme";
```

If your project uses `sass` for styling:

```scss
@import "tailwindcss";
@use "igniteui-theming/tailwind/theme";
```

> Ensure the import path resolves correctly from `node_modules`.

## Using Ignite UI Custom Utility Classes
The `igniteui-theming` package includes a custom Tailwind configuration that exposes Ignite UI design tokens through utility classes. These include support for:

- Colors and contrast colors

- Elevation (shadows)

- Typography styles

Letâ€™s look at how to use each.

#### Color Utility Classes
Use Ignite UI color tokens directly in your HTML:
```html
<h1 class="bg-primary-500 text-primary-500-contrast">This is a title</h1>
```

You can explore Tailwindâ€™s full color system [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/color), and apply it using the Ignite UI-provided class names.
<br>

#### Shadow utility classes

You can add depth using any of the predefined [elevation levels](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/themes/elevations) (from 0 to 24):

```html
<div class="shadow-elevation-8">Elevated container</div>
```

You can find all the shadow-related utility classes provided by Tailwind [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/box-shadow)
<br>

#### Typography custom utility styles
We provide custom utility classes for each typography level (e.g., h1, h2, body-1). Use them like so:

```html
<p class="type-style-h3">This paragraph gets the h3 styles</p>
```
Each class applies all necessary font settings, spacing, and sizing according to the [Ignite UI type scale](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/themes/typography).

>[!NOTE]
>These custom typography utilities only work outside of `ig-typography`. If you have to set the `ig-typography` CSS class on a top-level element, these styles won't apply.
<div class="divider--half"></div>

## Sample

In the following sample you can see a fully custom card, built entirely using Tailwind utility classes, including our `custom utility classes` for `shadows`, `colors` and `typography`. On the other side we have an `igx-card` component. While it provides a clean layout and accessibility features, its theming is driven by the Ignite UI theming engine, which limits direct styling with Tailwind classes due to CSS specificity.

> ðŸ”§ If you need more control over styling the Ignite UI Components, we recommend using the available `CSS custom properties` or the `Component Themes`.

<code-view style="height: 440px" 
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:demosBaseUrl}" 
           iframe-src="{environment:demosBaseUrl}/theming/tailwind-sample" alt="Tailwind Card Example">
</code-view>

## Summary
With just a few configuration steps, you can combine Tailwindâ€™s utility-first approach with Ignite UIâ€™s robust design system. This integration allows you to rapidly build consistent, themed UI components using well-defined tokens for color, elevation, and typographyâ€”right from your HTML.
