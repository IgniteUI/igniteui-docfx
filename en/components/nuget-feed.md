> [!Note]
> When adding a NuGet package from this source for the first time, you will be prompted for your Infragistics credentials.

## Adding with the NuGet CLI

1 - Download the [latest Nuget executable](https://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline/latest/nuget.exe). Instruct your browser to save the file to a folder of your choice. The file is not an installer; you won't see anything if you run it directly from the browser.
2 - Open a command prompt in the folder path of the `nuget.exe` file you just downloaded.
3 - Execute the following command

    nuget sources add -name "Infragistics" -source "https://packages.infragistics.com/nuget/licensed" -username "your login email" -password "your password"

> [!Note]
> The password will be stored encrypted in the NuGet config file and can only be decrypted in the same user context as it was encrypted. The default location of the config file can be found here `%AppData%\NuGet\NuGet.config`
