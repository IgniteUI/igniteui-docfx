# Angular Shape Files Reference

## Purpose

This topic provides resources about maps and geo-spatial related material as well as information about shape files. Use these resources to learn about and obtain shape files as well as tools for their editing before starting to bind geo-spatial data to the Ignite UI for Angular map component™ control.

## Resources

## Geo-spatial Overview

Before plotting geo-spatial data in the control, one should get familiar with the following resources which provide general information about maps and geo-spatial data.

-   [Wikipedia – Cartography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartography)

-   [National Atlas of the United States – Geographic Locations](http://nationalatlas.gov/articles/mapping/a_latlong.html)

-   [National Atlas of the United States – Map Projections](http://nationalatlas.gov/articles/mapping/a_projections.html)

-   [U.S. Geological Survey](http://www.usgs.gov/)

-   [Wikipedia – Map Projections](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection)

-   [University of Colorado – Map Projections](http://www.colorado.edu/geography/gcraft/notes/mapproj/mapproj_f.html)

## Shape Files Format

The Angular [`IgxGeographicMapComponent`]({environment:dvApiBaseUrl}/products/ignite-ui-angular/api/docs/typescript/latest/classes/igxgeographicmapcomponent.html) control uses popular [Shape Files](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile#Overview) format as one of the sources for geo-spatial data. Shape files are usually shipped with other file types, generally files with  _.shp_, _.shx_, and _.dbf_  extensions.

The following table provides basic information and purpose for each type of shape files.

| File Extension | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.shp`         | A shape file contains geo-spatial vector data items that describe points, polylines, and polygons. In this file, points may describe cities, polylines may describe roads, and polygons may describe shapes/borders of countries in geographic context.                                                                                         |
| `.shx`         | A shape index file contains an index for a quick lookup of a geo-spatial vector data items.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `.dbf`         | A shape database file contains a table in which a row corresponds to each geo-spatial data item from a shape (.shp) file. In the shape database file, string columns may describe attributes for geo-spatial data item such as strings (names of countries, regions, cities) and numeric columns (population of countries, location of cities). |

Refer to the following resources for detailed information and specifications on how geo-spatial data is stored in shape files.
