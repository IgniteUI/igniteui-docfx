# Grid ActionStrip

The Grid component in Ignite UI for Angular provides the ability to use `ActionStrip` component to achieve row actions. 
By default, we are providing two grid action components:

- [`IgxGridEditingActionsComponent`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxgrideditingactionscomponent.html) - includes functionality and UI related to grid editing. It allows you to quickly toggle edit mode for cells or rows, depending on the value of the `rowEditable` option of the grid and whether deleting rows is allowed.
- [`IgxGridPinningActionsComponent`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxgridpinningactionscomponent.html) - includes functionality and UI related to grid row pinning. It allows you to quickly pin rows and navigate between pinned rows and their disabled counterparts.

```html
<igx-grid [data]="data" [rowEditable]="true" [primaryKey]="'ID'">
    <igx-column *ngFor="let c of columns" [field]="c.field">
    </igx-column>

    <igx-action-strip #actionStrip>
        <igx-grid-pinning-actions></igx-grid-pinning-actions>
        <igx-grid-editing-actions></igx-grid-editing-actions>
    </igx-action-strip>
</igx-grid>
```

You can use the them or create custom component and then add it to the `ActionStrip`. If you want to use `ActionStrip` to achieve a Gmail scenario with row actions such as `delete`, `edit` and etc. You can simply create button component with `igx-icon`, add click event to it and insert it into the `igx-action-strip` component.

```html
 <igx-action-strip #actionstrip>
    <igx-grid-pinning-actions></igx-grid-pinning-actions>
        <button title="Edit" igxButton="icon" igxRipple (click)='startEdit(actionstrip.context)'>
            <igx-icon>edit</igx-icon>
        </button>
        <button title="Delete" igxButton="icon" igxRipple *ngIf='!isDeleted(actionstrip.context)' (click)='actionstrip.context.delete()'>
            <igx-icon>delete</igx-icon>
        </button>
    </igx-action-strip>
</igx-grid>
```

<code-view style="height: 600px;" 
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:demosBaseUrl}" 
           iframe-src="{environment:demosBaseUrl}/grid/grid-action-strip" >
</code-view>
