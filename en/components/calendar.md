# Angular Calendar Component Overview

Angular Calendar is a UI component used for displaying dates and days in an app. Supporting different features, it enables users to easily manage calendar functionalities, drag and create events in a calendar, navigate to a preferred date in it, and show events in an Angular calendar month view, week view, or day view in a single click.

<p class="highlight">

The Ignite UI for Angular Calendar component, developed as a native [Angular component](https://angular.io/guide/architecture#components), provides an easy and intuitive ways to display date information, enable dates or apply Angular calendar disable dates mode. Users can choose from three different selection modes - single selection, multi selection or range selection.
</p>

## Angular Calendar Example

We created the following Angular Calendar example using the Ignite UI for Angular Calendar package. It quickly shows how a basic calendar looks and feels like, how users can choose and highlight a single date, and how to move back and forth to a specific date.

</code-view>


## Getting Started with Ignite UI for Angular Calendar

To get started with the Ignite UI for Angular Calendar component, first you need to install Ignite UI for Angular. In an existing Angular application, type the following command:

```cmd
ng add igniteui-angular
```

For a complete introduction to the Ignite UI for Angular, read the [*getting started*](general/getting-started.md) topic.

The next step is to import the `IgxCalendarModule` in your **app.module.ts** file.

>[!NOTE]
> The [**IgxCalendarComponent**]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxcalendarcomponent.html) also depends on the [`BrowserAnimationsModule`](https://angular.io/api/platform-browser/animations/BrowserAnimationsModule) and **optionally** the [`HammerModule`](https://angular.io/api/platform-browser/HammerModule) for touch interactions, so they need to be added to the AppModule as well:

```typescript
// app.module.ts
...
import { HammerModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations';
import { IgxCalendarModule } from 'igniteui-angular';
// import { IgxCalendarModule } from '@infragistics/igniteui-angular'; for licensed package

@NgModule({
    ...
    imports: [..., BrowserAnimationsModule, HammerModule, IgxCalendarModule],
    ...
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Alternatively, as of `16.0.0` you can import the `IgxCalendarComponent` as a standalone dependency, or use the [`IGX_CALENDAR_DIRECTIVES`](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/blob/master/projects/igniteui-angular/src/lib/calendar/public_api.ts) token to import the component and all of its supporting components and directives.

```typescript
// home.component.ts

import { HammerModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { BrowserAnimationsModule } from '@angular/platform-browser/animations';
import { IGX_CALENDAR_DIRECTIVES } from 'igniteui-angular';
// import { IGX_CALENDAR_DIRECTIVES } from '@infragistics/igniteui-angular'; for licensed package

@Component({
    selector: 'app-home',
    template: '<igx-calendar></igx-calendar>',
    styleUrls: ['home.component.scss'],
    standalone: true,
    imports: [BrowserAnimationsModule, HammerModule, IGX_CALENDAR_DIRECTIVES]
    /* or imports: [BrowserAnimationsModule, HammerModule, IgxCalendarComponent] */
})
export class HomeComponent {}
```

Now that you have the Ignite UI for Angular Calendar module or directives imported, you can start using the `igx-calendar` component.

> [!NOTE]
> The [`IgxCalendarComponent`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxcalendarcomponent.html) uses the [Intl Web API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/DateTimeFormat) for localization and formatting of dates.
Consider using [appropriate polyfills](https://github.com/andyearnshaw/Intl.js/) if your target platform does not support them.

## Using the Angular Calendar

### Angular Single Selection Calendar

Instantiating the `IgxCalendarComponent` is as easy as placing its selector element in the template. This will display the current month in the single selection calendar mode.

```html
<!-- app.component.html -->
<!-- Single selection mode -->
<igx-calendar></igx-calendar>
```

### Angular Calendar Multiselect  

We can easily change the default mode using the [`selection`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxcalendarcomponent.html#selection) property:

```html
<!-- app.component.html -->
<!-- Multi selection mode -->
<igx-calendar selection="multi" [showWeekNumbers]="true"></igx-calendar>
```


<code-view style="height: 360px" 
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:demosBaseUrl}" 
           iframe-src="{environment:demosBaseUrl}/scheduling/calendar-sample-1" >
</code-view>


### Angular Calendar Range Picker

Following the same approach, we can switch to range selection mode:

```html
<!-- app.component.html -->
<!-- Range selection mode -->
<igx-calendar selection="range"></igx-calendar>
```


<code-view style="height: 480px" 
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:demosBaseUrl}" 
           iframe-src="{environment:demosBaseUrl}/scheduling/calendar-sample-8" >
</code-view>


> [!NOTE]
> Notice that the calendar header is not rendered when the selection is either `multi` or `range`.

### Localization and Formatting

Due to their very nature, localization and formatting are essential to any calendar. In the `IgxCalendarComponent` those are controlled and customized through the following properties - [`locale`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxcalendarcomponent.html#locale), [`formatOptions`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxcalendarcomponent.html#formatoptions), [`formatViews`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxcalendarcomponent.html#formatViews), [`weekStart`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxcalendarcomponent.html#weekStart).

Let's go ahead and try those along with other customizations from the `IgxCalendarComponent API`. First thing we need to set is the `weekStart`, which controls the starting day of the week. It defaults to 0, which corresponds to Sunday, so we will set a value of 1 for Monday. In the markup below we are also binding the `formatOptions` and `formatViews` properties to customize the display formatting. Finally, we are binding the `locale` property to a value, based on the user's location choice:

```html
<!-- app.component.html -->
<igx-select #select [(ngModel)]="locale">
    <igx-select-item *ngFor="let locale of locales" [value]="locale">
        {{ locale }}
    </igx-select-item>
</igx-select>

<igx-calendar #calendar
    [weekStart]="1"
    [locale]="locale"
    [formatOptions]="formatOptions"
    [formatViews]="formatViews">
</igx-calendar>
```
All property values should be set in the AppCоmponent file:

```typescript
// app.component.ts
@ViewChild('calendar', { read: IgxCalendarComponent }) public calendar: IgxCalendarComponent;

public formatOptions: any;
public formatViews: any;
public locales = ['EN', 'DE', 'FR', 'AR', 'ZH'];
public locale = 'EN';

public ngOnInit() {
    this.formatOptions = { day: '2-digit', month: 'long', weekday: 'long', year: 'numeric' };
    this.formatViews = { day: true, month: true, year: true };
}
```

If everything went well, we should now have a calendar with customized dates display, that also changes the locale representation, based on the user location. Let's have a look at it:


<code-view style="height: 580px" 
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:demosBaseUrl}" 
           iframe-src="{environment:demosBaseUrl}/scheduling/calendar-sample-2" >
</code-view>


### How to Disable Dates In Angular Calendar 
This section demonstrates the usage of [`disabledDates`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxcalendarcomponent.html#disabledDates) functionality. For this purpose, different single dates or ranges can be added to an array and then passed to the `disabledDates` descriptor.

The [`DateRangeType`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/enums/daterangetype.html) is used to specify a range that is going to be disabled.

Let's create a sample that is disabling the dates between the 3rd and the 8th of the current month:

```typescript
export class CalendarSample6Component {
    @ViewChild('calendar') public calendar: IgxCalendarComponent;
    public today = new Date(Date.now());
    public range = [
        new Date(this.today.getFullYear(), this.today.getMonth(), 3),
        new Date(this.today.getFullYear(), this.today.getMonth(), 8)
    ];

    public ngOnInit() {
        this.calendar.disabledDates = [{ type: DateRangeType.Between, dateRange: this.range }];
    }
}
```

These configurations should have the following result:


<code-view style="height: 420px" 
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:demosBaseUrl}" 
           iframe-src="{environment:demosBaseUrl}/scheduling/calendar-sample-6" >
</code-view>


### Special dates
The [`specialDates`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxcalendarcomponent.html#specialDates) feature is using almost the same configuration principles as the `disabledDates`. The ability to select and focus `specialDates` is what differs them from the `disabled` ones.

Let's add some `specialDates` to our `igxCalendar`. In order to do this, we have to create a [`DateRangeDescriptor`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/interfaces/daterangedescriptor.html) item of type [`DateRangeType.Specific`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/enums/daterangetype.html#specific) and pass an array of dates as a [`dateRange`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/interfaces/daterangedescriptor.html#dateRange):

```typescript
export class CalendarSample7Component {
    @ViewChild('calendar', { static: true })
    public calendar: IgxCalendarComponent;
    @ViewChild('alert', { static: true })
    public dialog: IgxDialogComponent;
    public range = [];

    public selectPTOdays(dates: Date[]) {
        this.range = dates;
    }

    public submitPTOdays(eventArgs) {
        this.calendar.specialDates =
            [{ type: DateRangeType.Specific, dateRange: this.range }];

        this.range.forEach((item) => {
            this.calendar.selectDate(item);
        });

        ...
    }
}
```

```html
<igx-calendar #calendar weekStart="1"
    selection="multi"
    (selected)="selectPTOdays($event)">
</igx-calendar>
<igx-dialog #alert title="Request Time Off"
    leftButtonLabel="OK"
    (leftButtonSelect)="alert.close()">
</igx-dialog>
<button igxButton="contained" (click)="submitPTOdays($event)">Submit Request</button>
```

The following demo illustrates a calendar with a vacation request option:


<code-view style="height: 400px" 
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:demosBaseUrl}" 
           iframe-src="{environment:demosBaseUrl}/scheduling/calendar-sample-7" >
</code-view>


### Week numbers

You can now use [`showWeekNumbers`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxcalendarcomponent.html#showWeekNumbers) input to show the week numbers for both Calendar and DatePicker components.

```html

<!-- app.component.html -->
<igx-calendar selection="multi" [showWeekNumbers]="true"></igx-calendar>
```
The following demo illustrates a calendar with enabled week numbers:


<code-view style="height: 380px" 
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:demosBaseUrl}" 
           iframe-src="{environment:demosBaseUrl}/scheduling/calendar-sample-1" >
</code-view>


## Calendar Events
Let's explore the events emitted by the calendar:
- [`selected`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxcalendarcomponent.html#selected) - emitted when selecting date(s) in the calendar.
- [`viewDateChanged`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxcalendarcomponent.html#viewDateChanged) - emitted every time when the presented month/year is changed - for example after navigating to the `next` or `previous` month.
- [`activeViewChanged`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxcalendarcomponent.html#activeViewChanged) - emitted after the active view is changed - for example after the user has clicked on the `month` or `year` section in the header.

```html
<!-- app.component.html -->
<igx-calendar #calendar
    (selected)="onSelection($event)"
    (viewDateChanged)="viewDateChanged($event)"
    (activeViewChanged)="activeViewChanged($event)">
</igx-calendar>
```
The [`selected`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxcalendarcomponent.html#selected) event is suitable to build input validation logic. Use the code from below to alert the user if selection exceeds 5 days, and then reset the selection:

```typescript
// app.component.ts
...
public onSelection(dates: Date[]) {
    if (dates.length > 5) {
        this.calendar.selectedDates = [];
        // alert the user
    }
}
public viewDateChanged(event: IViewDateChangeEventArgs) {
    // use event.previousValue to get previous month/year that was presented.
    // use event.currentValue to get current month/year that is presented.
}

public activeViewChanged(event: CalendarView) {
    // use CalendarView[event] to get the current active view (DEFAULT, YEAR or DECADE)
}
```

Use the demo below to play around (change selection, navigate through months and years) and see the events logged real time:

<code-view style="height: 420px" 
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:demosBaseUrl}" 
           iframe-src="{environment:demosBaseUrl}/scheduling/calendar-sample-3" >
</code-view>



## Angular Calendar Views 
There are separate views provided by the `IgxCalendarModule` that can be used independently:
-  Angular Calendar Days View  - [`igx-days-view`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxdaysviewcomponent.html)


<code-view style="height: 400px" 
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:demosBaseUrl}" 
           iframe-src="{environment:demosBaseUrl}/scheduling/calendar-days-view" >
</code-view>


- Angular Calendar Month View  - [`igx-months-view`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxmonthsviewcomponent.html)


<code-view style="height: 290px" 
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:demosBaseUrl}" 
           iframe-src="{environment:demosBaseUrl}/scheduling/calendar-months-view" >
</code-view>


- Angular Calendar Year View  - [`igx-years-view`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxyearsviewcomponent.html)


<code-view style="height: 320px" 
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:demosBaseUrl}" 
           iframe-src="{environment:demosBaseUrl}/scheduling/calendar-years-view" >
</code-view>


## Keyboard navigation
If you traverse the page using *Tab key* you should keep in mind that based on [W3 accessibility recommendations](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#layoutGrid) the *igxCalendarComponent* now introduces the following tab stops:
- Previous month button
- Month selection button
- Year selection button
- Next month button
- Selected date, Current date, First focusable (not disabled) date in the days view

In an Angular Calendar that contains more than one selected dates, only the first date will be introduced as a tab stop. For example, when an Angular Calendar multi-select is enabled and you have selected the dates: *13/10/2020*, *17/10/2020* and *21/10/2020* only *13/10/2020* will be accessible during tab navigation; in an Angular Calendar Range Picker, only the first date of the selected range will be part of the *page tab sequence*.

>[!NOTE]
> Behavioral change, from *v10.2.0* - Tab key navigation in the *days view* is no longer available. In order to navigate between the dates in the *date view* you should use the *arrow keys*.

When the `igxCalendar` component is focused, use:
- <kbd>PageUp</kbd> key to move to the previous month,
- <kbd>PageDown</kbd> key to move to the next month,
- <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>PageUp</kbd> keys to move to the previous year,
- <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>PageDown</kbd> keys to move to the next year,
- <kbd>Home</kbd> key to focus the first day of the current month  or first month in view
- <kbd>End</kbd> key to focus the last day of the current month or last month in view

When the `prev` or the `next` month buttons (in the subheader) are focused, use:
- <kbd>Space</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to scroll into view the next or previous month.

When the `months` button (in the subheader) is focused, use:
- <kbd>Space</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to open the months view.

When the `year` button (in the subheader) is focused, use:
- <kbd>Space</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to open the decade view.

When a `day` inside the current month is focused:
- Use *Arrow keys* to navigate through the days. Note: The disabled dates will be skipped.
- Focus will be persisted on the current month that is in the view, while navigation **from**/**to** the **last day**/**first day** of the month.
- THe kb navigation would be continuous, which means that it will go through all months while navigating with the arrows.
- Use <kbd>Enter key</kbd> to select the currently focused day.

When a `month` inside the months view is focused, use:
- Arrow keys to navigate through the months.
- <kbd>Home</kbd> key to focus the first month inside the months view.
- <kbd>End</kbd> key to focus the last month inside the months view.
- <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to select the currently focused month and close the view.

When an `year` inside the decade view is focused, use:
- <kbd>Arrow up</kbd> and <kbd>Arrow down</kbd> keys to navigate through the years,
- <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to select the currently focused year and close the view.

>[!NOTE]
>Following version 8.2.0, keyboard navigation will not focus days that are outside of current month, but will rather change the month in view.

## Multi View Calendar
Multi-view calendar supports all three types of selection. Use the [`monthsViewNumber`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxcalendarcomponent.html#monthsViewNumber) input to set the number of displayed months, which will be shown horizontally in a flex container. There is no limit on the max value set. While using a multi view calendar, you may want to hide the days that do not belong to the current month. You are able to do it with the [`hideOutsideDays`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxcalendarcomponent.html#hideOutsideDays) property.  Keyboard navigation moves to next/previous months when those are in view.


<code-view style="height: 500px" 
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:demosBaseUrl}" 
           iframe-src="{environment:demosBaseUrl}/scheduling/multiview-calendar" >
</code-view>

## Calendar Orientation
The orientation settings allows users to choose how the header and the view of the calendar are displayed.

#### Header Orientation Options:

You can change the header orientation to place the header of the calendar to be either horizontal(above the calendar view) or vertical(on the side of the calendar view).
To do that, use the `[headerOrientation]` property, setting it respectively to `horizontal` or `vertical`

#### View Orientation Options:

You can set the view orientation to place the months in the calendar either horizontally(side by side) or vertically(above one another).
To do that, use the `[orientation]` property, setting it respectively to `horizontal` or `vertical`.

>[!NOTE]
> You need at least two month view calendar to see that property working.

```html
<igx-calendar [monthsViewNumber]="2" [headerOrientation]="headerOrientation" [orientation]="orientation"></igx-calendar>
```

```typescript
const orientations = ["horizontal", "vertical"] as const;
type Orientation = (typeof orientations)[number];

export class CalendarSample9Component {
    protected orientations = Array.from(orientations, (o) => o);
    protected headerOrientation: Orientation = "horizontal";
    protected orientation: Orientation = "horizontal";

    protected setHeaderOrientation(orientation: Orientation) {
        this.headerOrientation = orientation;
    }

    protected setOrientation(orientation: Orientation) {
        this.orientation = orientation;
    }
}
```

<code-view style="height: 750px" 
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:demosBaseUrl}" 
           iframe-src="{environment:demosBaseUrl}/scheduling/calendar-sample-9" alt="Angular Calendar Orientation Example">
</code-view>

## Styling

To get started with styling the calendar, we need to import the `index` file, where all the theme functions and component mixins live:

```scss
@use "igniteui-angular/theming" as *;

// IMPORTANT: Prior to Ignite UI for Angular version 13 use:
// @import '~igniteui-angular/lib/core/styles/themes/index';
``` 

Following the simplest approach, we create a new theme that extends the [`calendar-theme`]({environment:sassApiUrl}/themes#function-calendar-theme) and by specifying just the `$header-background` and `$content-background` parameters, the theme will automatically compute appropriate state colors and contrast foregrounds. Of course, you're still free to override any of the theme parameters with custom values if needed.

```scss
$custom-calendar-theme: calendar-theme(
  $header-background: #ecaa53,
  $content-background: #011627,
);
```

The last step is to pass the custom calendar theme:

```scss
 @include css-vars($custom-calendar-theme);
```

In the sample below, you can see how using the calendar with customized CSS variables allows you to create a design that visually resembles the calendar used in the [`SAP UI5`](https://ui5.sap.com/#/entity/sap.ui.unified.Calendar/sample/sap.ui.unified.sample.CalendarSingleDaySelection) design system. 

<code-view style="height:350px"
