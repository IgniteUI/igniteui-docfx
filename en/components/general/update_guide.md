## Update Guide

In the Ignite UI for Angular [versioning](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/wiki/Ignite-UI-for-Angular-versioning) the first number always matches the major version of Angular the code supports and the second is dedicated for major version releases. Breaking changes may be introduced between major releases.
A comprehensive list of changes for each release of **Ignite UI for Angular** can be found in the product [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

The Ignite UI for Angular package also supports automatic version migration through `ng update` schematics. Those will attempt to migrate all possible breaking changes (renamed selectors, classes and @Input/Output properties), however there might be still changes that cannot be migrated. Those are usually related to typescript application logic and will be described [additionally below](#additional-manual-changes).

First run the [**`ng update`**](https://angular.io/cli/update) command which will analyze your application and available updates for its packages.
```cmd
ng update
```

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend commit all your changes before proceeding with the update. 

To update the **Ignite UI for Angular** package run the following command:
```cmd
ng update igniteui-angular
```
When you update `igniteui-angular` - it's recommended to update `@angular/core`, `@angular/cli` and `igniteui-cli` packages to their matching versions. 
To update the **Ignite UI CLI** package run the following command:
```cmd
ng update igniteui-cli
```
To update the **Angular Core** package run the following command:
```cmd
ng update @angular/core
```
To update the **Angular CLI** package use the following command:
```cmd
ng update @angular/cli
```

## Additional manual changes


Unfortunately not all changes can be automatically updated. Changes bellow are split into sections as they occur in the versions, so if any updates are required you should start from your current version and apply further updates from bottom to top.

For example: if you are updating from version 6.2.4 to 7.1.0 you'd start from the "From 6.x .." section apply those changes and work your way up:

### From 8.1.x to 8.2.x

* IgxDrag
    * Since `hideBaseOnDrag` and `visible` inputs are being deprecated, in order to achieve the same functionality in your application, you can use any way of hiding the base element that Angular provides. One example is setting the `visibility` style to `hidden`, since it will only make in invisible and keep its space that it takes in the DOM:

        ```html
        <div igxDrag [ngStyle]="{ 'visibility': targetDragged ? 'hidden' : 'visible' }"
            (dragStart)="onDragStarted($event)" (dragEnd)="onDragEnded($event)">
            Drag me!
        </div>
        ```

        ```typescript
        public targetDragged = false;

        public onDragStarted(event) {
            this.targetDragged = true;
        }

        public onDragEnded(event) {
            this.targetDragged = false;
        }
        ```

    * Since `animateOnRelease` and `dropFinished()` are also being deprecated, any `dropFinished()` method usage should be replaced with `transitionToOrigin()`. Otherwise you would need to call `transitionToOrigin()` depending on when you would want the dragged element to transition back to its original location. Note that  if the dragged element DOM position is changed, then its original location will also change based on that.

* IgxDrop
    * Due to the default drop strategy provided with the `IxgDrop` directive is no longer applied by default, in order to continue having the same behavior, you need to set the new input `dropStrategy` to be the provided `IgxAppendDropStrategy` implementation.

        ```html
        <div igxDrop [dropStrategy]="appendStrategy"></div>
        ```
        ```typescript
        import { IgxAppendDropStrategy } from 'igniteui-angular';

        public appendStrategy = IgxAppendDropStrategy;
        ```
    * Any use of interfaces `IgxDropEnterEventArgs` and `IgxDropLeaveEventArgs` should be replaced with `IDragBaseEventArgs`.
    * Also any use of the  `IgxDropEventArgs` interface should be replaced with `IDropDroppedEventArgs`.

* IgxCombo
    * The way that the [`igx-combo`](../combo.md) handles selection and data binding is changed.

    - If the combo's [`valueKey`] input is defined, the control will look for that specific property in the passed array of data items when performing selection.
    **All** selection events are handled with the value of the data items' `valueKey` property.
    All combos that have `valueKey` specified should have their selection/two-way binding consist only of the values for the object property specified in the input:
    ```html
    <igx-combo [data]="cities" valueKey="id" displayKey="name"></igx-combo>
    ```
    ```typescript
    export class MyExampleCombo {
        public data: { name: string, id: string }[] = [{ name: 'London', id: 'UK01' }, { name: 'Sofia', id: 'BG01' }, ...];
        ...
        selectFavorites() {
            // Selection is handled with the data entries' id properties
            this.combo.selectItems(['UK01', 'BG01']);
        }
    }
    ```

    - If the combo **does not** have a `valueKey` defined, **all** selection events are handled with **equality (===)**.
    All combos that **do not** have a `valueKey` specified should have their selection/two-way binding handled with **references** to their data items:
    ```html
    <igx-combo [data]="cities" displayKey="name"></igx-combo>
    ```
    ```typescript
    export class MyExampleCombo {
        public data: { name: string, id: string }[] = [{ name: 'London', id: 'UK01' }, { name: 'Sofia', id: 'BG01' }, ...];
        ...
        selectFavorites() {
            // Selection is handled with references to the data entries
            this.combo.selectItems([this.data[0], this.data[1]]);
        }
    }
    ```

    You can read more about setting up the combo in the [readme](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/blob/master/projects/igniteui-angular/src/lib/combo/README.md#value-binding) and in the [official documentation](../combo.md#selection).

### From 8.0.x to 8.1.x
* The `igx-paginator` component is introduced as a standalone component and is also used in the Grid components.
Keep in mind that if you have set the `paginationTemplate`, you may have to modify your CSS to display the pagination correctly. This is due to the fact that the template is no longer applied under a paging-specific container with CSS rules to center content, so you might need to add them manually.
The style should be something similar to:

```html
<igx-grid #grid [data]="data" [paging]="true" [perPage]="10" [paginationTemplate]="pager">
</igx-grid>
<ng-template #pager>
    <div class="pagination-container"></div>
</ng-template>
```

```css
.pagination-container {
	display: flex;
	justify-content: center;
	align-items: center;
}
```

### From 7.3.x to 8.0.x
* While updating, if you face the following error `Package "@angular/compiler-cli" has an incompatible peer dependency to "typescript" (requires ">=3.1.1 <3.3", would install "3.4.5").`, you should update `@angular/core` package first. This is related to this known [Angular CLI issue](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13095)
* While updating the `igniteui-angular` package, if you see the following error `Package "igniteui-angular" has an incompatible peer dependency to "web-animations-js" (requires "^2.3.1", would install "2.3.2-pr208")`, you should update using `ng update igniteui-angular --force`. This could happen if you update `@angular/core` and `@angular/cli` before updating `igniteui-angular`.

### From 7.2.x or 7.3.x to 7.3.4
* If you use the `filterGlobal` method of `IgxGrid`, `IgxTreeGrid` or `IgxHierarchicalGrid`, you should know that the `condition` parameter is no longer optional. When the `filterGlobal` method is called with an invalid condition, it will not clear the existing filters for all columns.

### From 7.1.x to 7.2.x
* If you use an IgxCombo with `combo.value`, you should know that now `combo.value` is only a getter.
* If you use `IgxTextHighlightDirective`, you should know that the `page` input property is deprecated. `rowIndex`, `columnIndex` and `page` properties of the `IActiveHighlightInfo` interface are also deprecated. Instead, `row` and `column` optional properties are added.
* If you use the `igx-button-theme`, you should know that the `$button-roundness` has been replaced for each button type with: `$flat-border-radius`, `$raised-border-radius`, `$outline-border-radius`, `$fab-border-radius`,  `$icon-border-radius`. 

### From 7.0.x to 7.1.x
 * If you use an IgxGrid with summaries in your application, you should know that now the `IgxSummaryOperand.operate()` method is called with empty data in order to calculate the necessary height for the summary row. For custom summary operands, the method should always return an array of IgxSummaryResult with proper length.

	Before version 7.1:
```typescript	
export class CustomSummary extends IgxNumberSummaryOperand {
	public operate(data?: any[]): IgxSummaryResult[] {
		return [{
			key: 'average',
			label: 'average',
			summaryResult: IgxNumberSummaryOperand.average(data).toFixed(2)
		}];
	}
}
```

	Since version 7.1:
```typescript
export class CustomSummary extends IgxNumberSummaryOperand {
	public operate(data?: any[]): IgxSummaryResult[] {
		return [{
			key: 'average',
			label: 'average',
			summaryResult: data.length ?  IgxNumberSummaryOperand.average(data).toFixed(2) : null
		}];
	}
}
```

### From 6.0.x to 6.1.x

* If you use an IgxCombo control in your application and you have set the `itemsMaxWidth` option, you should change this option to `itemsWidth`
