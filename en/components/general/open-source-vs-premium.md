# Open-Source vs Premium in Ignite UI for Angular

Ignite UI for Angular offers two distinct paths for building modern, data-driven applications: Open-Source Components and Premium Components. This dual approach ensures flexibility for developers at every stage of their project.

## Open-Source Components

There are over 50+ UI components available under the MIT license, including [Grid Lite](../grid-lite/overview.md), Accordion, Avatar, Badge, Banner, Button, Calendar, Carousel, Checkbox, Chip, Combo, Date Picker, Drop Down, Input, List, Snackbar, and more. You can find the full list in the [Comparison Table for All Components](#comparison-table-for-all-components).

All Open-Source components are marked in the header of their topics with: ![alt text](../../images/open-source-text.png)

They are ideal for lightweight applications that need essential functionality without the overhead of enterprise features. You can use them freely in production, customize, fork, and contribute via GitHub. No license is required.

## Premium Components

Our Ignite UI Premium components come with advanced enterprise features and are used for complex applications requiring high-performance and richer functionality. Premium components include:

### Grids and advanced components

- [Data Grid](../grid/grid.md), [Hierarchical Grid](../hierarchicalgrid/hierarchical-grid.md), [Tree Grid](../treegrid/tree-grid.md), [Pivot Grid](../pivotGrid/pivot-grid.md)
- [Dock Manager](../dock-manager.md)
- [Query Builder](../query-builder.md)
- [Charting library](../charts/chart-overview.md)
- [Maps library](../geo-map.md)
- [Excel Library](../excel-library.md)
- [Spreadsheet](../spreadsheet-overview.md)
- Gauges - [Bullet Graph](../bullet-graph.md), [Linear Gauge](../linear-gauge.md) and [Radial Gauge](../radial-gauge.md)

All Premium components are marked in the header of their topics with: ![alt text](../../images/premium-text.png)

All the Premium components can be evaluated locally and even tested in production with watermarking. However, a commercial license is required for customer-facing deployments and for unlocking the full power of the advanced Grids, Charts, and other Premium controls.

## Upgrade Path

Start with Grid Lite for essential needs and seamlessly upgrade to the full-featured Data Grid as your application grows in complexity. This ensures minimal refactoring and a smooth transition to enterprise-grade capabilities.
