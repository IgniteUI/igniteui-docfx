## Data Analysis  
This topic introduces Grid's integration with charting functionality, which allows the end user to visualize a chart based on Grid's selected data and choose different chart types if needed. Data analysis is the process of examining, transforming, and arranging data in a specific way to generate useful information from it. Data analysis allows for the evaluation of data through analytical and logical reasoning to lead to some sort of outcome or conclusion in some context.

The chart will be shown by selecting a range of cells and by clicking on the show analysis button.

<div class="sample-container loading" style="height: 650px;">
    <iframe id="grid-dynamic-chart" frameborder="0" seamless="" width="100%" height="100%" data-src="{environment:demosBaseUrl}/grid/grid-dynamic-chart-data" class="lazyload"></iframe>
</div>

We currently support the following Chart types:
- [ColumnGrouped](../../data-chart-type-category-series.md), [AreaGrouped](../../data-chart-type-category-area-series.md), [LineGrouped](../../data-chart-type-category-line-series.md), [BarGrouped](../../data-chart-type-category-series.md)
- [ColumnStacked](../../data-chart-type-stacked-column-series.md), [AreaStacked](../../data-chart-type-category-spline-area-series.md), [LineStacked](../../data-chart-type-stacked-line-series.md), [BarStacked](../../data-chart-type-stacked-bar-series.md)
- Column100Stacked, [Area100Stacked](../../data-chart-type-stacked-100-area-series.md), [Line100Stacked](../../data-chart-type-stacked-100-line-series.md), [Bar100Stacked](../../data-chart-type-stacked-100-bar-series.md)
- ScatterPoint, ScatterBubble, ScatterLine. In order to show meaningful Scatter Bubble Chart we disable the preview when the data is not in valid format.
- [Pie Chart](../../pie-chart.md)

> Note: This functionality will be introduced as a Directive in order to ease the configuration and limit the required code at minimum
