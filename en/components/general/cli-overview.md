# Angular Schematics & Ignite UI CLI
Our CLI tools provide project templates pre-configured for Ignite UI for Angular that help you get your next app off the ground in record time. A selection of views with Ignite UI for Angular components that can be further added to projects provide a substantial productivity boost for developers.

[Ignite UI CLI](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-cli) is a stand-alone command-line tool for creating and scaffolding applications for a variety of frameworks. You can find more information and examples about its usage in the [Getting Started with Ignite UI CLI](./cli/getting-started-with-cli.md) topic.

[Ignite UI for Angular Schematics](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-cli/tree/master/packages/ng-schematics) are available as a collection that can be used with the [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/guide/schematics#schematics-for-the-angular-cli). They offer similar core Ignite UI CLI functionality, but one that's integrated with the Schematics workflow and focused specifically on this product. The schematics collection is added to your project when you [install Ignite UI for Angular](getting-started.md#installing-ignite-ui-for-angular). You can find more information and examples about its usage in the [Getting Started with Ignite UI for Angular Schematics](./cli/getting-started-with-angular-schematics.md) topic.

Both versions of the tooling allow for various projects, component and scenario views (templates) and offer [guided step-by-step mode using Ignite UI CLI](./cli/step-by-step-guide-using-cli.md) and [Ignite UI for Angular Schematics](./cli/step-by-step-guide-using-angular-schematics.md).
