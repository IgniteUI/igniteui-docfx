## Transforming Data With Angular Pipes

> [!Video https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gmz5kio50FE]

In WPF in order to transform data from one value to another, you are going to use an [IValueConverter](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.data.ivalueconverter?view=netframework-4.8). To transform data in an Angular application, we are going to use a [Pipe](https://angular.io/api/core/Pipe). The pipe is very similar to the WPF converter. It takes data as an input and then transforms that data into a desired output for display.

Angular provides a number of predefined pipes for the most common data transformations. For example, if you want a header text to appear in upper case, you could use the [UpperCasePipe](https://angular.io/api/common/UpperCasePipe). Using a pipe is very simple. After your expression, provide a pipe operator `|` followed by the pipe name.

```html
<h2>{{ header | uppercase }}</h2>
```

What is really great about the pipes in Angular compared to a WPF converter is that you can actually use more than one pipe at a time. So, for example you can use a [DatePipe](https://angular.io/api/common/DatePipe) and [UpperCasePipe](https://angular.io/api/common/UpperCasePipe) in order to format the date to a user-friendly format and make it uppercase:

```html
<h2>{{ birthday | date | uppercase }}</h2>
```

Besides that, we also have the option to provide parameters to the pipe. For example, the [DatePipe](https://angular.io/api/common/DatePipe) has parameters like format, time zone and locale.

```html
<h2>{{ birthday | date:"MM/dd/yy" }}</h2>
```

## Create Your Own Pipe

Besides using the predefined pipes, Angular allows you to define your own pipes. Let's take a look at the implementation of a WPF converter that replaces a string with another one.

```csharp
public class ReplaceConverter : IValueConverter
{
    public string OldValue { get; set; }
    public string NewValue { get; set; }

    public object Convert(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)
    {
        var strValue = value.ToString();
        return strValue.Replace(this.OldValue, this.NewValue);
    }

    public object ConvertBack(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
}
```

```xml
<Window.Resources>
    <local:ReplaceConverter OldValue=" " NewValue="-" x:Key="replaceConverter"></local:ReplaceConverter>
</Window.Resources>
<Grid>
    <TextBlock Text="{Binding Path=Name, Mode=OneWay, Converter={StaticResource replaceConverter}}"></TextBlock>
</Grid>
```

In order to do the same in Angular, we have to define a class that implements the [PipeTransform](https://angular.io/api/core/PipeTransform) interface and has the [@Pipe](https://angular.io/api/core/Pipe) decorator.

```typescript
import { Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular/core';

@Pipe({
    name: 'replace'
})
export class ReplacePipe implements PipeTransform {

    transform(value: string, oldValue: string, newValue: string): string {
        return value.replace(oldValue, newValue);
    }
}
```

```html
<span>{{ name | replace:" ":"-" }}</span>
```
> [!NOTE]
> Note that in order to be able to use the pipe in the component's html template, you have to add it to the module declarations.

> [!NOTE]
> An important difference between the Angular pipe and the WPF converter is that the Angular pipe works only for one-way binding unlike the WPF converter which has [ConvertBack](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.data.ivalueconverter.convertback?view=netframework-4.8) method.
