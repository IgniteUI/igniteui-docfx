## Transaction Service

The [`Transaction Service`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/interfaces/transactionservice.html) is an injectable middleware (through [Angular's DI](https://angular.io/guide/dependency-injection)) that a component may use to accumulate changes without immediately affecting the underlying data.

> [!NOTE]
> The data transformation from the schema above is not mandatory. You do not need to use a pipe in order to use the [`Transaction Service`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/interfaces/transactionservice.html).

The [`Transaction Service`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/interfaces/transactionservice.html) allows adding transactions. After at least one transaction is added, you may commit or clear all the changes or the changes for a single record only. As it keeps a detailed log, it can also execute undo and redo operations.

Every time you execute an operation ([**transaction**]({environment:angularApiUrl}/interfaces/transaction.html)), it is added to the transaction log and undo stack. All the changes in the transaction log are then accumulated per record. From that point, the service maintains an aggregated **state** that consists only of add/update/delete operations for unique records. This is based on a [`State`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/interfaces/state.html) interface which has three properties: `recordRef`, `type` and `value`.

We have built three classes on top of the [`Transaction Service`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/interfaces/transactionservice.html) that provide the user with the ability to commit all the changes he has made, or the changes he has made to a given record, at once. Those classes are [`igxBaseTransactionService`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxbasetransactionservice.html), [`igxTransactionService`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxtransactionservice.html) and [`igxHierarchicalTransactionService`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxhierarchicaltransactionservice.html).

The [`igxTransactionService`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxtransactionservice.html) and [`igxHierarchicalTransactionService`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxhierarchicaltransactionservice.html) are fully integrated in our [igxGrid]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxgridcomponent.html), [igxHierarchicalGrid]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxhierarchicalgridcomponent.html) and [igxTreeGrid]({environment:angularApiUrl}/classes/igxtreegridcomponent.html) components. You may find detailed examples of using those components with transactions enabled in the following topics:
* [igxGrid Batch Editing and Transactions](grid/batch_editing.md)
* [igxHierarchicalGrid Batch Editing and Transactions](hierarchicalgrid/batch_editing.md)
* [igxTreeGrid Batch Editing and Transactions](treegrid/batch_editing.md)

A more detailed overview of the opportunities that the [`Transaction Service`]({environment:angularApiUrl}/interfaces/transactionservice.html) provides may be found in our ["Building a transaction service for managing large scale editing experiences" blog](https://blog.angular.io/building-a-transaction-service-for-managing-large-scale-editing-experiences-ded666eafd5e)
