# Angular Chart Animations

Animations allows you to ease-in the series as it loads a new data source. The available animation differs depending on the type of series involved. For example, the column series animates by rising from the x-axis, a line series animates by drawing from the origin of y-axis.

Animations are disabled in the Ignite UI for Angular Charts, but they can be enabled by setting the [`isTransitionInEnabled`]({environment:dvApiBaseUrl}/products/ignite-ui-angular/api/docs/typescript/latest/classes/igxcategorychartcomponent.html#istransitioninenabled) property to true. From there, you can set the [`transitionInDuration`]({environment:dvApiBaseUrl}/products/ignite-ui-angular/api/docs/typescript/latest/classes/igxcategorychartcomponent.html#transitioninduration) property to determine how long your animation should take to complete and the [`transitionInMode`]({environment:dvApiBaseUrl}/products/ignite-ui-angular/api/docs/typescript/latest/classes/igxcategorychartcomponent.html#transitioninmode) to determine the type of animation that takes place.

## Angular Chart Animation Example

The following example depicts a [Line Chart](../types/line-chart.md) with an animation set to the default [`transitionInMode`]({environment:dvApiBaseUrl}/products/ignite-ui-angular/api/docs/typescript/latest/classes/igxcategorychartcomponent.html#transitioninmode) - "Auto." The drop-down and slider at the top in this example will allow you to modify the [`transitionInMode`]({environment:dvApiBaseUrl}/products/ignite-ui-angular/api/docs/typescript/latest/classes/igxcategorychartcomponent.html#transitioninmode) and [`transitionInDuration`]({environment:dvApiBaseUrl}/products/ignite-ui-angular/api/docs/typescript/latest/classes/igxcategorychartcomponent.html#transitioninduration), respectively, so that you can see what the different supported animations look like at different speeds.

<code-view style="height: 500px"
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}"
           iframe-src="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/charts/category-chart-line-chart-with-animations"
           alt="Angular Configuration Options Example"

</code-view>

<div class="divider--half"></div>
