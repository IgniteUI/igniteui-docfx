# Angular Map

The Ignite UI for Angular map component allows you to display data that contains geographic locations from view models or geo-spatial data loaded from shape files on geographic imagery maps.

## Demo

<code-view style="height: 400px"
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}"
           iframe-src="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/maps/geo-map-overview"  >
</code-view>

<div class="divider--half"></div>

The map component allows you to render geographic imagery from Bing Mapsâ„¢, and Open Street Maps. The map provides plotting of tens of thousands of data points, and updates them every few milliseconds so that the control can handle your real-time feeds.

The map's Series property is used to support rendering an unlimited number of geographic series. This property is a collection of geographic series objects and any type of geographic series can be added to it. For example, [`IgxGeographicSymbolSeriesComponent`]({environment:dvApiBaseUrl}/products/ignite-ui-angular/api/docs/typescript/latest/classes/igxgeographicsymbolseriescomponent.html) can be added for plotting geographic locations such as cities and the [`IgxGeographicPolylineSeriesComponent`]({environment:dvApiBaseUrl}/products/ignite-ui-angular/api/docs/typescript/latest/classes/igxgeographicpolylineseriescomponent.html) for plotting connections (e.g. roads) between these geographic locations.

The map provides customizable navigation behaviors for navigating map content using mouse, keyboard, or code-behind.

<!-- Angular, React, WebComponents -->

## Dependencies

To use the geographic map component, you need to first install these packages:

-   **npm install --save igniteui-angular-core**
-   **npm install --save igniteui-angular-charts**
-   **npm install --save igniteui-angular-maps**
    <!-- end: Angular, React, WebComponents -->

## Required Modules

The [`IgxGeographicMapComponent`]({environment:dvApiBaseUrl}/products/ignite-ui-angular/api/docs/typescript/latest/classes/igxgeographicmapcomponent.html) requires the following modules:

```ts
// app.module.ts
import { IgxMapModule } from "igniteui-angular-maps";

@NgModule({
    imports: [
        // ...
        IgxMapModule,
        // ...
    ]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

<div class="divider--half"></div>

## Usage

Now that the map module is imported, next step is to create geographic map. The following code demonstrates how to do this and enable zooming in the map.
