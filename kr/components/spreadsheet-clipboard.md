# Angular Working with Clipboard

This topic explains how to perform clipboard operations.

## Demo

<code-view style="height: 500px"
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}"
           iframe-src="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/excel/spreadsheet-clipboard"
           github-src="excel/spreadsheet/clipboard">
</code-view>

<div class="divider--half"></div>

## Dependencies

Before making use of the clipboard you will want to import the SpreadsheetAction

```ts
import { IgxSpreadsheetComponent } from 'igniteui-angular-spreadsheet';
import { SpreadsheetAction } from 'igniteui-angular-spreadsheet';
```

<div class="divider--half"></div>

## Usage

The following snippet shows how you can setup the data validation rules

```ts
@ViewChild("spreadsheet", { read: IgxSpreadsheetComponent })
public spreadsheet: IgxSpreadsheetComponent;

// ...

public cut(): void {
    this.spreadsheet.executeAction(SpreadsheetAction.Cut);
}

public copy(): void {
    this.spreadsheet.executeAction(SpreadsheetAction.Copy);
}

public paste(): void {
    this.spreadsheet.executeAction(SpreadsheetAction.Paste);
}
```
