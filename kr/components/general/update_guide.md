## Update Guide

In the Ignite UI for Angular [versioning](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/wiki/Ignite-UI-for-Angular-versioning) the first number always matches the major version of Angular the code supports and the second is dedicated for major version releases. Breaking changes may be introduced between major releases.
A comprehensive list of changes for each release of **Ignite UI for Angular** can be found in the product [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/IgniteUI/igniteui-angular/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

The Ignite UI for Angular package also supports automatic version migration through `ng update` schematics. Those will attempt to migrate all possible breaking changes (renamed selectors, classes and @Input/Output properties), however there might be still changes that cannot be migrated. Those are usually related to typescript application logic and will be described [additionally below](#additional-manual-changes).

First run the [**`ng update`**](https://angular.io/cli/update) command which will analyze your application and available updates for its packages.
```cmd
ng update
```

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend commit all your changes before proceeding with the update. 

To update the **Ignite UI for Angular** package run the following command:
```cmd
ng update igniteui-angular
```
When you update `igniteui-angular` - it's recommended to update `@angular/core`, `@angular/cli` and `igniteui-cli` packages to their matching versions. 
To update the **Ignite UI CLI** package run the following command:
```cmd
ng update igniteui-cli
```
To update the **Angular Core** package run the following command:
```cmd
ng update @angular/core
```
To update the **Angular CLI** package use the following command:
```cmd
ng update @angular/cli
```

## Additional manual changes


Unfortunately not all changes can be automatically updated. Changes bellow are split into sections as they occur in the versions, so if any updates are required you should star from your current version and apply further updates from bottom to top.

For example: if you are updating from version 6.2.4 to 7.1.0 you'd start from the "From 6.x .." section apply those changes and work your way up:

### From 7.3.x to 8.0.x
* While updating, if you face the following error `Package "@angular/compiler-cli" has an incompatible peer dependency to "typescript" (requires ">=3.1.1 <3.3", would install "3.4.5").`, you should update `@angular/core` package first. This is related to this known [Angular CLI issue](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13095)
* While updating the `igniteui-angular` package, if you see the following error `Package "igniteui-angular" has an incompatible peer dependency to "web-animations-js" (requires "^2.3.1", would install "2.3.2-pr208")`, you should update using `ng update igniteui-angular --force`. This could happen if you update `@angular/core` and `@angular/cli` before updating `igniteui-angular`.

### From 7.2.x or 7.3.x to 7.3.4
* If you use the `filterGlobal` method of `IgxGrid`, `IgxTreeGrid` or `IgxHierarchicalGrid`, you should know that the `condition` parameter is no longer optional. When the `filterGlobal` method is called with an invalid condition, it will not clear the existing filters for all columns.

### From 7.1.x to 7.2.x
* If you use an IgxCombo with `combo.value`, you should know that now `combo.value` is only a getter.
* If you use `IgxTextHighlightDirective`, you should know that the `page` input property is deprecated. `rowIndex`, `columnIndex` and `page` properties of the `IActiveHighlightInfo` interface are also deprecated. Instead, `row` and `column` optional properties are added.
* If you use the `igx-button-theme`, you should know that the `$button-roundness` has been replaced for each button type with: `$flat-border-radius`, `$raised-border-radius`, `$outline-border-radius`, `$fab-border-radius`,  `$icon-border-radius`. 

### From 7.0.x to 7.1.x
 * If you use an IgxGrid with summaries in your application, you should know that now the `IgxSummaryOperand.operate()` method is called with empty data in order to calculate the necessary height for the summary row. For custom summary operands, the method should always return an array of IgxSummaryResult with proper length.

	Before version 7.1:
```typescript	
export class CustomSummary extends IgxNumberSummaryOperand {
	public operate(data?: any[]): IgxSummaryResult[] {
		return [{
			key: 'average',
			label: 'average',
			summaryResult: IgxNumberSummaryOperand.average(data).toFixed(2)
		}];
	}
}
```

	Since version 7.1:
```typescript
export class CustomSummary extends IgxNumberSummaryOperand {
	public operate(data?: any[]): IgxSummaryResult[] {
		return [{
			key: 'average',
			label: 'average',
			summaryResult: data.length ?  IgxNumberSummaryOperand.average(data).toFixed(2) : null
		}];
	}
}
```

### From 6.0.x to 6.1.x

* If you use an IgxCombo control in your application and you have set the `itemsMaxWidth` option, you should change this option to `itemsWidth`
