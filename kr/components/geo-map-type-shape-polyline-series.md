## Using Shape Polyline Series

Use the map component's [`IgxGeographicPolylineSeriesComponent`]({environment:dvApiBaseUrl}/products/ignite-ui-angular/api/docs/typescript/latest/classes/igxgeographicpolylineseriescomponent.html) to display geo-spatial data using polylines in a geographic context. This type of geographic series is often used to render roads or connections between geographic locations such as cities or airports.

### Demo

<div class="sample-container loading" style="height: 400px">
    <iframe id="geo-map-type-shape-polyline-series-iframe" src='{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/maps/geo-map-type-shape-polyline-series' width="100%" height="100%" seamless frameBorder="0" onload="onXPlatSampleIframeContentLoaded(this);"></iframe>
</div>
<div>
    <button data-localize="stackblitz" disabled class="stackblitz-btn"   data-iframe-id="geo-map-type-shape-polyline-series-iframe" data-demos-base-url="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}">View on StackBlitz
    </button>
</div>

<div class="divider--half"></div>

The [`IgxGeographicPolylineSeriesComponent`]({environment:dvApiBaseUrl}/products/ignite-ui-angular/api/docs/typescript/latest/classes/igxgeographicpolylineseriescomponent.html) works a lot like the [`IgxGeographicShapeSeriesComponent`]({environment:dvApiBaseUrl}/products/ignite-ui-angular/api/docs/typescript/latest/classes/igxgeographicshapeseriescomponent.html) except that geo-spatial data is rendered with polylines instead of polygons.

### Data Requirements

Similarly to other types of geographic series in the control, the [`IgxGeographicPolylineSeriesComponent`]({environment:dvApiBaseUrl}/products/ignite-ui-angular/api/docs/typescript/latest/classes/igxgeographicpolylineseriescomponent.html) has the `ItemsSource` property which can be bound to an array of objects. In addition, each data item in this object must have one data column that stores single/multiple shapes using an array of arrays of objects with x and y values representing geographic locations. This data column is then mapped to the ShapeMemberPath property. The [`IgxGeographicPolylineSeriesComponent`]({environment:dvApiBaseUrl}/products/ignite-ui-angular/api/docs/typescript/latest/classes/igxgeographicpolylineseriescomponent.html) uses points of this mapped data column to plot polygons in the control.

### Code Snippet

The following code shows how to bind the [`IgxGeographicPolylineSeriesComponent`]({environment:dvApiBaseUrl}/products/ignite-ui-angular/api/docs/typescript/latest/classes/igxgeographicpolylineseriescomponent.html) to locations of cities loaded from a shape file using the `ShapeDataSource`.
