# Angular Using Shape Polygon Series

Use the map component's [`IgxGeographicShapeSeriesComponent`]({environment:dvApiBaseUrl}/products/ignite-ui-angular/api/docs/typescript/latest/classes/igxgeographicshapeseriescomponent.html) to display geo-spatial data using shape polygons in a geographic context. This type of geographic series is often used to render shapes of countries or regions defined by geographic locations.

## Demo

<code-view style="height: 400px" 
           data-demos-base-url="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}" 
           iframe-src="{environment:dvDemosBaseUrl}/maps/geo-map-type-shape-polygon-series"  >
</code-view>

<div class="divider--half"></div>

The [`IgxGeographicShapeSeriesComponent`]({environment:dvApiBaseUrl}/products/ignite-ui-angular/api/docs/typescript/latest/classes/igxgeographicshapeseriescomponent.html) works a lot like the [`IgxGeographicPolylineSeriesComponent`]({environment:dvApiBaseUrl}/products/ignite-ui-angular/api/docs/typescript/latest/classes/igxgeographicpolylineseriescomponent.html) except that geo-spatial data is rendered with polygons instead of polylines.

## Data Requirements

Similar to other types of geographic series in the map control, the [`IgxGeographicShapeSeriesComponent`]({environment:dvApiBaseUrl}/products/ignite-ui-angular/api/docs/typescript/latest/classes/igxgeographicshapeseriescomponent.html) has the `ItemsSource` property which can be bound to an array of objects. In addition, each data item in this object must have one data column that stores single/multiple shapes using an array of arrays of objects with x and y values representing geographic locations. This data column is then mapped to the `ShapeMemberPath` property. The [`IgxGeographicShapeSeriesComponent`]({environment:dvApiBaseUrl}/products/ignite-ui-angular/api/docs/typescript/latest/classes/igxgeographicshapeseriescomponent.html) uses points of this mapped data column to plot polygons in the map control.

## Code Snippet

The following code demonstrates how to bind the [`IgxGeographicShapeSeriesComponent`]({environment:dvApiBaseUrl}/products/ignite-ui-angular/api/docs/typescript/latest/classes/igxgeographicshapeseriescomponent.html) to shapes of countries in the world loaded from a shape file using the `ShapeDataSource`.
